# Technic Test

My work for the cancelled technic test, feel free to use the code and fork the repository as you please!

Features:

- Random generation of 300 users with unique ID's (can theoretically generate as many as possible, but over 1k tends to make things lag)
- Reading and writing user information from and to a .txt file
- Checking current time live to see if it is lunchtime
- Also checks if user has already eaten today
